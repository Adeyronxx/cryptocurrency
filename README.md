# cryptocurrency
In this project, i will be analyzing data using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. My intention is to group a cryptocurrency dataset into a classification system which a cryptocurrency investment portfolio can be built upon.  

# Resources
* Jupyter Notebook
* Cryptocurrency csv

# RESULTS 

To begin the analysis first we had to load and clean data set, as shown below.
